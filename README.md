Components of UNIX:
------------------

User

&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;

Application

&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;

Shell

&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;

Kernal

&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;

Hardware

----

Shell:
-----
It is the outer layer of UNIX OS.
It reads our command verify whether it is valid or not and whether it is properly used or not. If everthing is proper the shell convert/interpretes the command into kernal understandable form and have over the kernal.
Shell acts as interface bitween user and kernal.

Kernal:
----
It is the core component of UNIX OS.
It is reponsible to execute our command.
It is reponsible for memory allocation and time allocation.
Kernal acts or interface bitween shell and hardware

Note:
Shell and kernal together considered as operating system.

Command Exicution Flow:
-----

|         |            |
| :-----------: |:-------------:|
| End User types a command on the terminal eg. touch sunny.txt| |
| command will be submitted to the shell      |      |
| shell checks whether this command is valid or not and whether it is properly used or not| If it is not proper display error message to the terminal|
| kernal exicute that command and perform required action | &#8739; |
| Again $ promt will be displayed to the teminal which indicates ready for the next command | &#8626; |
